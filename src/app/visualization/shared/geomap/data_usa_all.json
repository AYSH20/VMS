So for every project, we also encourage makers to tell story with their product.  Because we are already moving through a two step process (making and storytelling), it can be challenging to then ALSO ask them to document or reflect. We are excited to keep thinking about how to tackle this challenge and work to refine how our space fits into our community."

Because we rely on Volunteers for ALL of our activities, and each activity is executed with a new set of Volunteers, every bit of feedback can serve to improve both the participant and Volunteer experience as well as efficacy. Our feedback is fairly informal because the groups we work with are frequently not organized to provide individual feedback due to the burden that places on the event coordinators. We do strive to reach out to all participants including Volunteers individually Hoeven when we have contact info or through social media. With 6 plus Maker events  under our belt with participants ranging from 3 years old to over 80, we have incorporated feedback to improve logistics . We now have an \"Image Library\" to go with our training materials that helps remote event Partners to gather materials needed prior to events. We have also created templates for a variety of documents, from build plan outlines, to waivers, which helps the efficacy. ",

Some events may be closed (as our event today was at a preschool) with participants numbering 19- 60. Whereas other public events we participate in at Museums (such as last Sat/Sun May 20/21 at Museum of Flight) may have 500 to 2000 attendees. NoT all our events are Maker events however. Some are educational exhibits, but we always highlight the Maker activities, as that is how the Founder began in 1979 at her own school Whenever she was 11. We believe that Maker activities are critical to developing integrated thinking and teamwork through multi sensory and dimensional activities. This in turn can develop systems and critical thinking, and problem sloving skills as well as Teamwork!"
